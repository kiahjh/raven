description: Create consistent releases and changelogs

## What I do

- Propose a version bump (major, minor, patch)
- Once we've agreed, update the version in the following files:
  - package.json
  - tauri.conf.json
  - Cargo.toml
- Update the changelog (CHANGELOG.md), giving a brief overview of each new user-facing change
